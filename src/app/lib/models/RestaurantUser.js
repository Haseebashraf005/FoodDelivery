// in Mongoose, a model (like Product) is a constructor function that represents a MongoDB collection. Creating an instance of the model (e.g., new Product(payload)) creates a new document that corresponds to a single record in that collection.
// The payload (e.g., {"name": "Laptop", "price": 999}) contains the data for this document. Instantiating the model with new Product(payload) structures this data according to the schema defined for the Product model, ensuring itâ€™s ready to be saved to the MongoDB database.
// Example: If your Product schema defines fields like name and price, the new Product(payload) call creates a document with those fields, which can then be saved to the products collection in MongoDB.
